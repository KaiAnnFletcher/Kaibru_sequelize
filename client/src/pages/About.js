                With years of leadership and management experience in the corporate sector, Bruno has played a crucial role in directing the path and planning stages for this project. <br/>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                Kaibru's planning started late in 2018 and since then has taken many forms. This is the closest the team has come to having a solid, finished product.<br/>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                With that in mind, there is still more work to be done and he is excited to continue charting Kaibru's course!

                With roughly two years of full-stack (MERN) development experience under her belt, Kai-Ann enjoys building various projects while learning new concepts. <br />
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                Building Kaibru from the ground up was not quite an easy process, but the team decided that it would make the vision and mission more meaningful. <br/>
                &nbsp;
                &nbsp;
                With that in mind, Kai-Ann is excited to continue the building phase for Kaibru and is also excited to see the platform grow over time.
